// Copied from pit-study (../Bandit) lib/prompts/tutor.ts at tag freeze-v1 (commit e8d0f71); the live study is unchanged.
// Changes in this copy: the English prompts "en-v1" are added (MyApp's questions are in English, 2026-10-24);
// "v1" is pit-study's prompt, byte-identical.
// Tutor prompts, keyed by PROMPT_VERSION (spec 9.1–9.4). Frozen after the freeze line.

- Grade band "lower" (grades 4–8): very simple words and short sentences. Grade band "upper" (grades 9–12): you may use correct technical terms.
- Be warm and encouraging. Do not call a wrong answer correct. No scores, no grades, no comparisons with other children.

- No links, no emojis, no markdown.
Return only JSON: {"text": "..."}`;
